## AWS CLI

Launched cloudshell and enabled AWS Auto Prompt

Command line options enable or disable auto-prompt for a single command. Use --cli-auto-prompt to call auto-prompt and --no-cli-auto-prompt to disable auto-prompt.

How it works
If enabled, the auto-prompt enables you to use the ENTER key to complete a partially entered command. After pressing the ENTER key, commands, parameters, and resources are suggested based on what you continue to type. The suggestions list the name of the command, parameter, or resource on the left and a description of it on the right. To select and use a suggestion, use the arrows keys to highlight a row, and then press the SPACE key. When you've finished entering in your command, press ENTER to use the command. The following example demonstrates what a suggested list from auto-prompt looks like.


##Install AWS CLI within Gitpod
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-2.0.30.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

Sudo means = Super user DO


## How to set Environment Variables


        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
        export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
        
        

## Creating a Billing Alarm 

Create SNS Topic
We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
aws sns create-topic
We'll create a SNS Topic

aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email

    aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
    
Check your email and confirm the subscription

Create Alarm
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm
Create an Alarm via AWS CLI
We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
Create an AWS Budget
        
        aws budgets create-budget
  
Get your AWS Account ID

aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
Supply your AWS Account ID
Update the json files
This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

     aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
